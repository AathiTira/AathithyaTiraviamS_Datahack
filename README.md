# Method and Approach
1. Loading the Data:

    - Features and labels are loaded from separate CSV files.
    - The datasets are merged on the respondent_id column to create a unified DataFrame.

2. Preprocessing:

    - Missing Values: Categorical columns have missing values filled with the mode (most frequent value), and numerical columns are filled with the median.
    - Separate Features and Targets: The features (X) and target variables (y) are separated after merging the datasets.

3. Feature Identification:

    - Categorical Features: Columns that contain categorical data such as age_group, education, etc.
    - Numerical Features: Columns that contain numerical data. These are identified as all columns not in the list of categorical features.

4. Preprocessor Setup:

    - Numerical Data: Standardized using StandardScaler.
    - Categorical Data: Encoded using OneHotEncoder, which converts categorical variables into a form that can be provided to ML algorithms to do a better job in prediction.

5. Model Definition:

    - A RandomForestClassifier is used within a MultiOutputClassifier to handle the multilabel classification problem where each target variable (vaccine) is predicted separately.
    - A pipeline is created to streamline the preprocessing and model training steps.

6. Training and Validation:

    - The data is split into training and validation sets.
    - The model is trained on the training data.
    - Predictions are made on the validation set, and the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using the ROC AUC score, which measures the ability of the classifier to distinguish between classes.

7. Test Data Handling:

    - The test data is loaded and preprocessed similarly to the training data.
    - Predictions are made on the test data to generate probabilities for each target variable.

8. Submission Preparation:

    - A submission DataFrame is created with respondent_id and predicted probabilities for xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine.
    - The submission is saved to a CSV file.
