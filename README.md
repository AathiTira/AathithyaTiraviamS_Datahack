# Method and Approach
1. Data Preprocessing

    - Load the Data: The dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv() and the first few rows are displayed to understand its structure.
    - Handle Missing Values: Missing values in the dataset are filled with the median value of each column using data.fillna(data.median(), inplace=True). This is a simple strategy that can be further refined based on data characteristics.
    - Separate Features and Target Variables: The dataset is split into features (X) and target variables (y). The target variables are xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine, which are binary.
    - Identify Categorical and Numerical Features: Categorical features are identified for one-hot encoding, and numerical features for scaling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    - Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations: Although not explicitly shown in the code, EDA involves summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset, including distributions, correlations, and visualizations to uncover patterns.

3. Feature Engineering

    - Preprocessing Pipeline: A ColumnTransformer is used to preprocess numerical and categorical features separately. Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler, and categorical features are one-hot encoded using OneHotEncoder.

4. Model Selection and Training

    - Create the Model: A MultiOutputClassifier with a RandomForestClassifier is chosen to handle the multilabel problem. Random forests are robust and perform well on various types of data.
    - Create the Pipeline: A Pipeline combines the preprocessing steps and the model into a single object, ensuring that preprocessing is applied consistently during training and prediction.
    - Split the Data: The data is split into training and validation sets using train_test_split() to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

5. Model Evaluation

    - Train the Model: The pipeline is fitted on the training data.
    - Predict Probabilities: Probabilities for both target variables are predicted on the validation set using pipeline.predict_proba().
    - Evaluate the Model: The model's performance is evaluated using the ROC AUC score, a metric that measures the ability to distinguish between classes.

6. Prediction and Submission

    - Load Test Data: The test dataset is loaded for making predictions.
    - Predict Probabilities on Test Data: Probabilities are predicted for the test data.
    - Prepare Submission File: The results are formatted into a submission file as specified, with columns respondent_id, xyz_vaccine, and seasonal_vaccine.
    - Save Submission File: The submission file is saved as a CSV file for submission.
